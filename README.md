This project is designed to analyze tumor data of a population of mice who have been treated with various experimental drugs. 

Mice from a total population of 249 were each treated with one of ten different drugs and were studied based on how the volume of their tumors changed over time. The population was evenly divided among male and female mice with 50.2% male and 49.8% female. 

Four drugs were analyzed in greater detail (Capomulin, Ramicane, Infubinol and Ceftamin) and tumor volume after the final adminstration of the given drug was recorded. Capomulin and Ramicane had a lower median final tumor volume with () and () respectively versus Infubinol at () and Ceftamin at ().


The tumor volume did appear to decrease with time while administrating Capomulin while there was a positive correlation between overall mouse weight and the tumor volume. This is nearly a linear relationship with a regression slope of 0.95 and an r squared value of 0.71.
